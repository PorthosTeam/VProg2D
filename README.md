Game testing - 
WASD / arrows to move, 
Space to jump, 
1-3 to change player sprite, 
M to set and play BGM, 
S to play a sound, 
P to save stuff, 
click to draw a circle at the mouse position, 
E to spawn an enemy on the ground under the mouse, 
B for a text box because why not. 

Lots of this needs to be hooked into the UI, among 
other things. - Trevor
